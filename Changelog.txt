		when lightly damaged and above and (2) they only show if healing 1 HP takes longer than
		20 minutes.
	* New update button on the start page. Clicking it takes you directly to the latest version
		online. Does not show if there is no update.
	* Update notifications can now be clicked to take you to the latest version online. Text
		has been changed to reflect this.

		press the button for it.
	
v2.6.0 β r458 - 4/30/2014
	* Lots of back-end changes from Grabacr07. They mainly reimplement what I've done, but
		with an emphasis on making fleet updating more streamlined. Things should be faster.
		Hopefully this should also have less memory leakage.
	* Health now shows repair times for both the dock and the facility types. Facility timer 
		only shows when the ship is lightly damaged.

	* Item counts for instant buckets and repairs update in real-time

		Kancolle handles the information.

		for that ship to be repaired to 100%.

Note - Grabacr07 seems to be the rather difficult task of redoing how KCV manages all the ships 
	and fleets (branch named: tsurai-kedo-ganbarui). I was planning on doing a Repair Queue 
	tool, but this is on hold until he finishes up this insane task.

v2.6.0 β r439 - 4/25/2014 - To kill a bug
	* *Fix* Single ship updates - Kancolle now has packets that only update a single ship. KCV
		now supports these single ship updates.
	* *Fix* Flash Quality - When you are set to high quality, wmode is not set to what you've
		chosen. Now it should.
	* *Fix* Critical condition on start up - A nasty bug that caused everything in the menu's to
		be blank. If a ship was in crit. condition and was being repaired as you booted KCV up,
		everything would break.
	* *Fix* Translation toggle - Switching back and forth from translated to non-translated now
		works without having to restart KCV.
	* *Fix* LoS sorting was causing crashes once pressed due to using a wrong variable.
	* *New* Firepower, Torpedo, Anti-Air, Armor, and Luck are now sortable in the ship roster.	

v2.6.0 β r432 - 4/24/2014
	* A debug function was removed from the zoom function causing API links to restart the page.
	* Nothing else...

v2.6.0 β r431 - 4/24/2014
	* API links now work with the flash settings!
	* The item catalog will now display the item's original Japanese name under the translated 
		one. This does not show if you have translations disabled.
	* Ships will now show their original Japanese name with tool tips in the Fleet, Overview, 
		and Roster.	

v2.6.0 β r426 - 4/23/2014 - The Spring Time Youth
	* Direct fix from the main man himself, @Grabacr07.
	* Back end - All it was is just file name changes and a few additional packets.
The following has changed from how things worked previously:
	* **Fatigue values only update when you advance or withdraw from battle, not after battle.**
	* Rearrangement of the fleets will only update when you return to homeport (main menu).

v2.5.0 r420 - 4/22/2014 - The Spring Event
Note: Setting have been reset with this version! Please review them.
	* *New* Custom sound alerts. Works on all versions of windows. Will randomly pick
		an appropriate sound file under the "Sounds" folder. Acceptable formats are wav
		and mp3. There are also options to change it's playback volume.
	* *New* Fatigue notifications. When your fleet is suppose to recover their fatigue, you
		are notified. This is not 100% accurate and off by default.
	* Status bar now shows the information that is normally found in the fleet tab on the 
		overview tab as well.
	* Line of Sight calculation is shown in the status bar in both fleet and overview.
	* You can now sort the ship catalog by the extra stats.
	* There is no longer a minimum height set in vertical KCV. Scrollbars will only appear if
		you cover content in the window.
	* There is now a button in the update menu that takes you directly to the latest found
		version of KCV. The hyperlinks still work of course.
	* Translations will come as they are found/needed. Auto-update is our friend!

v2.4.0 r403 - 4/12/2014 - "To die for"
Note: Setting have been reset with this version! Please review them.
	* *New* Flash quality select option - Choose from Low to Best and anything inbetween.
	* *New* Flash window select option - Choose the rendering method in the browser.
	* *New* Mousing over a ship name in the overview tab, fleet tab, or equipment list 
		window will show the base ship stats.
	* *Fix* OSAPI links now properly display in KCV.
	* Browser settings now available in the start up settings menu
	* Tweaked margins in the overview tab. Scrollbars shouldn't appear until content doesn't
		fit the page.

Side Notes:
	* None of the flash settings work on SWF/API links.
	* You can however use the OSAPI link if you are still using it for the flash settings.
	* Do NOT use GPU window method! Its built for tablets and phones that have specialized 
		optimizations needed for flash. Do use it if you use the lowest quality setting though.
